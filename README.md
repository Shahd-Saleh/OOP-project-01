_______________________________________________________________________

No database used â€“ all data stored in memory via lists.

The focus is on logic, OOP design, and user interaction.

You can extend it with file handling or a database later.

what I have used:

Encapsulation: All data members are accessed through methods.

Abstraction: User interacts only with clear menu options.

Lists: To store multiple patients, doctors, and appointments dynamically.

Enums: Used for Doctor.Specialty to ensure valid predefined specialties (e.g., Dentist, Surgeon, etc.).

Foreach & If Statements: Used for searching within lists.

Enum.IsDefined(): Ensures valid user selection for specialty.

DateTime Parsing: For scheduling appointments accurately.
